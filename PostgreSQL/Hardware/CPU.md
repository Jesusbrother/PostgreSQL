# Estimating CPU Requirements for PostgreSQL Architecture

 You can use online calculators like https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua, and some tips below

## Steps to Estimate Required CPU

### 1. Determine Workload Profile (Read-Heavy or Write-Heavy)
   - **Read-Heavy**: For systems where most operations are read-intensive (e.g., analytics, reporting), more CPU resources are typically needed as analytical queries are CPU-intensive.
   - **Write-Heavy**: For systems with high-frequency writes (e.g., event logging), storage I/O and memory are prioritized, though CPU is still important.

### 2. Measure Current Load (If Possible)
   - Use PostgreSQL metrics and monitoring tools such as `pg_stat_activity`, `pg_stat_statements`, and cloud monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch for AWS) to analyze current CPU usage.
   - Identify peak CPU loads and average utilization to understand how the database performs with its current configuration.

### 3. Analyze Query Types and CPU Demands
   - **CPU-Intensive Queries**: Queries with aggregation, sorting, or joins on large tables need more CPU.
   - **High-Volume Data Queries**: Queries processing large datasets or full table scans require higher CPU.
   - Use **pg_stat_statements** to identify the most frequent and resource-intensive queries.

### 4. Calculate Based on Transactions Per Second (TPS)
   - Determine Transactions Per Second (TPS) or Queries Per Second (QPS).
   - Approximate benchmarks:
     - Simple SELECT queries: around 1000-2000 queries per second per core.
     - Complex analytical queries: about 100-200 queries per second per core.
   - Example: If 10,000 simple queries per second are required, approximately 5-10 CPU cores will be needed.

### 5. Use Concurrency Factor
   - Calculate active connections or transactions expected.
   - PostgreSQL performs optimally with 4-8 active processes per CPU core.
   - Example: For 100 concurrent connections, using a 4-to-1 ratio (4 connections per core), around 25 cores would be ideal.

### 6. Plan for Future Growth and Scalability
   - Include room for scaling as user demand increases (e.g., more users or higher query frequency).
   - Consider cloud scaling options like auto-scaling or clustering with replicas for horizontal scalability.

### 7. Example Configurations
   - **Light Loads** (small databases up to 100 GB, mostly reads): 2-4 CPU cores.
   - **Medium Loads** (mixed read/write, up to 1 TB): 8-16 CPU cores.
   - **Heavy Loads** (high-frequency writes, complex queries, > 1 TB data): 16-32+ CPU cores.

### CPU Example Calculation

Example scenario:
- 500 Transactions Per Second (TPS) mix of reads and writes
- Mostly simple SELECTs with INSERTs and UPDATES

Using a baseline of 1000 queries per second per core:
- 500 TPS requires about 0.5 cores but factoring in mixed operations and concurrency, about 5-8 CPU cores would ensure smooth operation.
